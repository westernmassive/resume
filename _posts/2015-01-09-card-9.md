* In 2012 - 2013 I learned how to steer a cruise ship and helped lead a passenger ship up and down the Snake River in Oregon.

* My apartment doubles as a Maker's Lab, and I teach friends how to create prototypes using my 3D Printer, vinyl plotter and other various tools.

* I once built an RV out of a 1977 Datsun and traveled the United States in it.
